/* Find all the years a particular date falls on particular day
between a span of variable years. 

This program finds all the years July 4th is on a Thursday,
and reveals answer inside the body of the document */

// Steps taken:
// grabs values of two inputs (years) and parent selector
// for loop until 1st input is not less than 2nd input
// increments years
// gets Date object, sets to July 4th with year as a variable
// gets day value of current Date object
/* if statment: if the day is thursday(4) and year is less than 2019,
console.log with answer of correct years in statement in past tense */
/* if statment: if the day is thursday(4) and year is more than 2019,
console.log with answer of correct years in statement in future tense */
